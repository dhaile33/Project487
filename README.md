INTRODUCTION 
This project involves building a uber like application that enables the customers to request for the ride. The application will be enabling the riders or users to request the ride after signing up to the application while the drivers will have the ability to know where the customer is requesting the ride from. 
The system provides up to date information regarding to services offered by the application. This is because the application is enabled with google map that work on real time, the moment the customer requests the ride, they are given the maximum waiting time and the cost for the services.
SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

SYSTEM REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
This section offers a clear and precise description of the system functions and operations.
It also shows what is going to be implemented in the system.
	Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what a system must accomplish.
This is a specification of particular results that a system should deliver.
The following are the functional requirements for the hostel management system.
